# Project 1 - Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

Description— According to EuropeanBusinessReview, telecommunication providers lose close to $65 million a month from customer churn. Isn’t that expensive? With many emerging telecom giants, the competition in the telecom sector is increasing and the chances of customers discontinuing a service are high. This is often referred to as Customer Churn in Telecom. Telecommunication providers that focus on quality service, lower—cost subscription plans, availability of content and features whilst creating positive customer service experiences have high chances of customer retention. The good news is that all these factors can be measured with different layers of data about billing history, subscription plans, cost of content, network/bandwidth utilization, and more to get a 360—degree view of the customer. This 360—degree view of customer data can be leveraged for predictive analytics to identify patterns and various trends that influence customer satisfaction and help reduce churn in telecom.
 
# Project 2 - Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm

Description— Whenever you visit a retail supermarket, you will find that baby diapers and wipes, bread and butter, pizza base and cheese, beer, and chips are positioned together in the store for sales. This is what market basket analysis is all about — analyzing the association among products bought together by customers. Market basket analysis is a versatile use case in the retail industry that helps cross—sell products in a physical outlet and also helps e—commerce businesses recommend products to customers based on product associations. Apriori and FP growth are the most popular machine learning algorithms used for association learning to perform market basket analysis.


# Project 3 - Building a Resume Parser Using NLP(Spacy) and Machine Learning

Description— Gone are the days when recruiters used to manually screen resumes for a long time. Sifting through thousands of candidates’ resumes for a job is no more a challenging task— all thanks to resume parsers. Resume parsers use machine learning technology to help recruiters search thousands of resumes in an intelligent manner so they can screen the right candidate for a job interview.

In this data science project, I've built an NLP algorithm that parses a resume and looks for the words (skills) mentioned in the job description. I have used the Phrase Matcher feature of the NLP library Spacy that does “word/phrase” matching for the resume documents. The resume parser then counts the occurrence of words (skills) under various categories for each resume that helps recruiters screen ideal candidates for a job.

# Project 4 - Price Recommendation for Online Sellers

Description— E—commerce platforms today are extensively driven by machine learning algorithms, right from quality checking and inventory management to sales demographics and product recommendations, all use machine learning. One more interesting business use case that e—commerce apps and websites are trying to solve is to eliminate human interference in providing price suggestions to the sellers on their marketplace to speed up the efficiency of the shopping website or app. That’s when price recommendation using machine learning comes to play.
